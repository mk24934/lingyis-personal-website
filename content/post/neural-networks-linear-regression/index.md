## Overview

In this post we will learn neural networks by doing linear regression with it. 

## Getting Started

The libraries that we will be using

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import tensorflow
```

## Linear Regression

Let's get the baseline

## Neural Network

Todo
